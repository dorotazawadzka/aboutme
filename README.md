I am looking for opportunities to develop my technical skills.<br>
Currently, I am refreshing my knowledge of SQL, HTML, CSS, JIRA, etc.</br>
I'm learning Playwright, Postman, E2E and API testing and more, whatever you need.

Privately: wife and mother of two.</br>
I like walking, pilates, running with obstacles, baking bread and cookies, card games, sudoku.
